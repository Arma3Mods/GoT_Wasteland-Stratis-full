<br/>
	What is GoT/GoT2DayZ?<br/><br/>
	GoT2DayZ started as a DayZ community for Tweakers.Net<br/>
	As time passed on we also started playing wasteland.<br/>
	Now we run some public servers.<br/>
	And also modify Wasteland missions for them.<br/>
	<br/>Our website: www.got2dayz.nl<br/><br>
	our servers:<br/>
	* DayZ Celle (Whitelisted)<br/>
	* ArmA2 Wasteland on Utes (Customized by us)<br/>
	* ArmA3 Alpha Wasteland on Stratis (Costomized by us)<br/>
	<br/>
	I cant urge enough that all credits for this mission go<br/>
	to the original makers at 404Games.co.uk!<br/>
